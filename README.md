# Long Term Surveillance Team at Florida International University

## Mission:
To leverage robotic surveillance tools for enhanced worker health and safety in high-risk environments. To establish robotic surveillance tools as a reliable and superior alternative to traditional inspection methods, enhancing worker safety and operational efficiency in high-risk environments.

### Objective:
Demonstrate the effectiveness of mobile robotic platforms in conducting safe and efficient inspections, replacing traditional methods that expose personnel to hazardous conditions. This project aims to reduce the reliance on human inspectors, decrease the risk of accidents and injuries, and improve operational decision-making by providing timely access to inspection data.

## Methodology
Our research focuses on employing remote mobile robotic platforms to collect environmental data in real-time. These versatile robots can be outfitted with sensor payloads that capture information similar to human inspectors. The data is transmitted instantly to a base station where operators can analyze and assess the environment, eliminating the need for personnel to physically enter hazardous facilities.

## Support
This project has been supported by the DOE-FIU Science & Technology Workforce Development Initiative, a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM) and Florida International University’s Applied Research Center (FIU-ARC).

## Contribution
Our research contributes to the development of innovative solutions for environmental monitoring and worker safety. By sharing our findings and experiences, we aim to facilitate the adoption of robotic surveillance technology in various industries, promoting safer and more efficient operations.

## Collaboration
We welcome collaborations with researchers, industry professionals, and stakeholders interested in exploring the potential of robotic surveillance tools for enhanced worker health and safety.
